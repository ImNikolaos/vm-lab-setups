# Virtual Machine Lab Setups

This repo documents how I created and used virtual machines to simulate IT environments for hands-on practice.

## ðŸ’» VM Environments

- **Windows 10 VM** (for user/account management)
- **Ubuntu Linux VM** (for command line and system tasks)
- **Practice network setup**

## ðŸ“‹ Whatâ€™s Included

- Installation steps
- Configuration screenshots
- Tasks performed (e.g., create users, install apps, update system)

## ðŸ§ª Goal

To simulate real-world scenarios safely, build confidence using different OS environments, and apply technical skills in isolated labs.
